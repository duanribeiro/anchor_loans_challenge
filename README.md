# The Problem

You got a request from a friend to create a gallery for his wedding where his friends will be able to upload their photos and he will have a unified gallery with all friend's photos.
He wants to be able to approve the photos before being visible to everyone. He and his wife should be the only ones able to approve new photos.
Users must be able to like photos and add comments to photos.


Please create a website that supplies their needs. The **photos must be saved on Amazon AWS S3** and the gallery must be fast to open even if there are many photos. You must **use python in the back-end** using any framework of your choice and **vue.js for the front-end**.


Details of the solution
* The resolution must be a web application.
* There must supply all the information needed to test the application
* The application must run
* The code needs to be hosted in your preferred code repository
* You need to host the application in a server of your choice and give us a link to access and use the application
* You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the requirements

My template was made on top of a database in MongoDB, the frontend using VueJS and Flask for backend.

Im deployed my backend on a Lambda function and my frontend is hosted on a static bucket on S3.
